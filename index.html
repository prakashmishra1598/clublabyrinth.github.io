<p align="justify"><font face="OpenSans-Light.ttf" size="4"><br/>In Greek mythology, Daedalus, the smartest of inventors, created an impenetrable maze. It was rumored that once a person entered the maze, nobody would be able to escape. But finally, a group of intelligent demigods entered the maze and were able to navigate their way through it.
The maze was dynamic, ever-changing, evolving and they needed to be able to adapt to it.
This is not very different from computers today. Nothing ever stays static, except a java main function. Computer Science people have a key to the world written in 1s & 0s which is non comprehensible by most other people. <br/><br/>
 
While the CS department's Computer Academy has been around since 1997 organizing all of the fests (Gateways, Interface, Techleons) behind the scenes, Labyrinth was created in order to give this academy a front end. Labyrinth, the Computer Science Club of Christ University is created solely to give students a platform to display their talents as well as grow while having the opportunity of exploring various topics in the Computer Science world. Labyrinth holds a variety of events every semester, ranging from technical events like coding & debugging competitions, logical puzzle challenges, web development/designing contests. But the main agenda of the club is not to make students compete with each other but to make them develop their skills. They need to identify what are they interested in.  The club organises Workshops / seminars / events by inviting people from industries. Unlike corporte connect, guests don't just focus on talks, but hands on and live demo, so that students understand the topic properly that are compulsory and useful in industries. <br/><br/>
 
Lastly, open source projects are a huge challenge to every individual computer fanatic. However, it's often difficult for the average student to try and contribute to an open source project as much as they'd like to. Hence, Labyrinth had decided to gather students with the will to learn and contribute towards an open source project and have them work as a team towards the same goal. Open source projects can be of immense benefit in terms of knowledge gained but are often too complicated for students to take on modules on their own. Therefore, by putting them in teams and having them complete one/two modules per semester, not only can they learn a lot as a group but also have the privilege of having contributed to an open source project.</p><br/>	</font>
